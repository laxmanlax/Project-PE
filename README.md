## Systems Design

- Design Google Search
- Caching and load balancing components
- Remote server troubleshooting (TCP/IP stack, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `strace`)
- Resource replication from N sources to M sinks
- Content publishing platform with privacy restrictions
- File storage system (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Recommendation service (e.g., celebrity recommendations)
- Social platform designs (Twitter, Instagram)
- Instagram client-side design
- Keyword search service in Facebook posts
- Contest system (e.g., HackerRank)
- Type-ahead feature design
- Scheduling service with SQL approach (table schemas, composite keys, concurrency)
- Uber system design
- Music provider analytics service (e.g., top 10 songs per user)

## Linux Systems and Internals

_(Add content for Linux internals here)_

## Networking

- Debugging network issues (latency, packet loss, ICMP)
- Tools: `strace`, `lsof`, `/proc` insights
- Virtual memory and demand paging

## Behavioral

- Work experience, past projects, and standard “tell me about a time” questions
- Hypothetical scenario questions (e.g., leadership, conflict resolution, decision-making)
- STAR format: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Sample prompts:
  - Tell me about your current role and responsibilities
  - Describe a project you’re proud of
  - Recall a time you had to give difficult feedback and how you handled it
  - What’s the most challenging problem you solved and what did you learn?
  - Which work environment brings out your best performance?
  - Share a decision from your past that significantly changed your path
  - Which skills or topics are you actively improving and what steps are you taking?
